In December 2023, we, at PRAGNOMOS, organized an AI Bootcamp called Agora, in which students from diverse disciplines came to learn about state-of-the-art AI technologies and expand their knowledge. In this Bootcamp, I was delighted to have given a talk on the technology behind Large Language Models, from the fundamentals of textual data in machine learning to the Attention mechanism and the Transformer architectures. Furthermore, I talked about the approach to building an LLM and its cost.
