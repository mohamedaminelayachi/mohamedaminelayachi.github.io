**Welcome**
===========================
I am pleased that you are interested in learning more about me. My name is Mohamed Amine Layachi, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality at Ibn Tofail University. My journey with computers began at the age of 6, allowing me to comprehend the intricacies involved in constructing one of the most groundbreaking inventions in history. I tend to delve into the essence of things. For example, I enjoy examining the green (or black) motherboard, understanding the functionalities of every component, and exploring the tiniest things in algorithms.

By the end of this page, you will have gained more insights into who I am. However, if you wish to engage in a conversation, please feel free to reach out to me. I welcome the opportunity to connect.

## Behind The Scenes: ChatGPT

In December 2023, we, at PRAGNOMOS, organized an AI Bootcamp called Agora, in which students from diverse disciplines came to learn about state-of-the-art AI technologies and expand their knowledge. In this Bootcamp, I was delighted to have given a talk on the technology behind Large Language Models, from the fundamentals of textual data in machine learning to the Attention mechanism and the Transformer architectures. Furthermore, I talked about the approach to building an LLM and its cost.


**A life outside the academic circle**
======
It's challenging for me to distinctively isolate my academic life as a separate entity from my overall life because inspiration often emerges unexpectedly. Nonetheless, I am an avid guitarist and have been playing since the age of 19. I delve into various genres, with a particular emphasis on Rock and its derivatives. Additionally, I am a music producer, having delved into this realm since the age of 15. My production primarily centers around EDM and Rock. The inception of my journey into music production was spurred by the necessity for a soundtrack for a game I was developing at the age of 13/14, titled Ponga. Regrettably, the game never came to fruition, but it led me to acquire a completely different skill set.
